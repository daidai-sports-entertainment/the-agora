   - 71 concepts spanning ancient to contemporary thought

2. **Intelligent Color Coding**
   - 🔵 Blue = Pure philosophy
   - 🔴 Red = Pure politics
   - 🟢 Cyan-Green = Philosophy + Politics intersection

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Color System

We use color to distinguish the nature of concepts:

- **Philosophy** (e.g., Platonism, Stoicism) → Blue
- **Politics** (e.g., Liberalism, Fascism) → Red
- **Interdisciplinary** (e.g., Marxism, Confucianism) → Cyan-Green

This highlights a key insight: **many ideas span both philosophy and politics**, which is the charm of intellectual history.

### Relationship Types

The visualization supports **76 different relationship types**, organized into 3 layers:

**Genealogical Layer** (Direct Influence):
- `influenced_by` / `influenced` - Direct influence
- `evolved_from` / `evolved_into` - Evolution
- `emerged_from` / `gave_rise_to` - Emergence
- `founded_on` / `foundation_for` - Foundation
- `built_on` / `provided_foundation_for` - Building upon
- And 40+ more...

**Ideological Layer** (Opposition/Critique):
- `opposes` / `opposed_by` - Opposition (red dashed lines)
- `critiques` / `critiqued_by` - Critique
- `challenges` / `challenged_by` - Challenge
- `reacts_against` - Reaction
- And 20+ more...

**Illustrative Layer** (Association):
- `similar_to` - Similarity
- `related_to` - Relation
- `synthesized_with` - Synthesis
- `exemplifies` - Exemplification
- And 15+ more...

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **D3.js v7** - Data visualization
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **sentence-transformers** - Semantic embeddings (Python backend)

## 📊 Data Explanation

### Data Sources

- `concept_positions_final.json` - Contains X/Y coordinates for each concept
  - X coordinate = Historical era
  - Y coordinate = Semantic similarity (UMAP reduced from 768-dim embeddings)

- `ideology_dataset_comprehensive.json` - Complete data
  - 71 concepts (includes Medieval, Enlightenment, and modern key ideas)
  - Each concept includes: description, key_figures, domains, relationships

### Embedding Generation

Used `all-mpnet-base-v2` model to generate 768-dimensional semantic embeddings, then reduced to 2D using UMAP.

See `../generate_embeddings.py` for details.

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Trace the Evolution of Marxism

1. Click the **🗺️ Path Mode** button (top-right controls)
2. Click **Marxism** (purple, 1850) as start point → Glows blue
3. Watch the constellation response: reachable concepts light up in yellow
4. Click **Kant** (blue, 1780) as end point → Glows green
5. See the influence path automatically calculated:
   ```
   ① Kant (1780)
     ↓ influenced
   ② Hegelianism (1830)
     ↓ influenced
   ③ Marxism (1850)
   ```
6. Info panel shows detailed path with relation descriptions
7. Click **✕** or **🗺️** again to exit path mode

### Example 2: Explore Marxism's Intellectual Network (Regular Mode)

1. Click **Marxism** node (purple, 1850)
2. Observe highlighted relationships:
   - ← Influenced by **Hegelianism** (blue)
   - → Gave rise to **Socialism** (red)
   - ⚔️ Opposes **Capitalism** (red dashed line)
3. Right panel shows full description and key figures (Karl Marx)
4. Click empty space to deselect and continue exploring

### Example 3: Compare Eastern and Western Ancient Philosophy

1. Zoom to ancient region (X-axis around -500)
2. Observe:
   - **Confucianism** (cyan-green) - Eastern, emphasizes political ethics
   - **Platonism** (blue) - Western, pure philosophy
3. Click both to compare differences and similarities
